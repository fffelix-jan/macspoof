# MacSpoof
  
MAC Address Spoofing App (now with GUI)!  
Made with AppleScript, Python, and shell scripts.  
Use these to spoof your Mac's Wi-Fi MAC address (usually to bypass blocking). However, use at your own risk!  
It is compatible with macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) and above. I'm not sure if it works with macOS 10.15 (Catalina) though, due to the stricter signing requirements, or macOS 11 (Big Sur). I wrote it on a computer running macOS 10.14 (Mojave).  
To view and edit the code, simply open "MacSpoof.app" with Script Editor.
